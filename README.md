# WBGT_sensitivity_framework
This repository describes the sensitivity framework for wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) developed by Kong and Huber (2024). The framework analytically evaluates the response of WBGT to changes in its meteorlogical input (temperature, specific humidity, wind and solar radiation).

The file ``WBGT_sensitivity_framework.py`` contains a brief description of the framework, and functions to calculate each term in the framework. For more details, please refer to Kong and Huber (2024).
